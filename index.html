        <p>We know. Not everyone innately knows how to be a baddie. It's much easier to be basic. And some of us *gasp* were born basic. BUT that does not mean you have to STAY basic. On Queen Bey, follow these steps to become your highest, baddest self. 😘</p>

    <ol class="list">
        <li>YOU have to believe you're a baddie. If you can't convince yourself, you can't expect to convince the rest of us.</li>
        <li>Cleanliness is next to...you know. Take care of yourself. Spend extra time pampering your body so that your outer glow matches your inner glow.</li>
        <li>Who are YOU? Don't become a copy&paste baddie. What do you like? What is your personal style. Don't follow trends, MAKE them.</li>
        <li>Chill babe. Don't force anything, otherwise it can make you feel and act desperate. And all baddies can smell desperation. Be the perfect YOU.</li>
        <li>Mirror mirror on the wall. The Evil Queen might have had something there. Speak life into yourself every day. Tell yourself you love you, you're a baddie, and all the good things. Because YOU ARE BADDIE❣️</li>
